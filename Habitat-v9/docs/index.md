## What is the goal of this project?

Habitat is a Sitecore solution example built on a modular architecture. The architecture and methodology focuses on:

* Simplicity - *A consistent and discoverable architecture*
* Flexibility - *Change and add quickly and without worry*
* Extensibility - *Simply add new features without steep learning curve*

For more information about the architecture and the principles and conventions behind it, please see the [Sitecore Helix guidelines](http://helix.sitecore.net)
